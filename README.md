# Beamer Theme
This is the customised beamer theme that I frequently use for presentations.
To use this theme in your own presentation, you need to include the required packages in your project (contained in `header/packages.tex`) and the customisation contained in `header/theme.tex`. 
The file `header/definitions.tex` contains common definitions, which **are not** required to use the theme.

See `slides.tex` for an example and an overview of the theme.
